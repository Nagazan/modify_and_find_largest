# 🖥️ modify_and_find_largest

Hey there! 

This is a simple **C program** that demonstrates how to use **pointers with arrays**. It shows how you can:  

- Access variable values through pointers 🧐  
- Modify values via pointers ✏️  
- Find the largest value in a set of variables 🔝

- `modify_and_find_largest.c` – The main C program file.

## 📝 How It Works

1. We declare four integer variables: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`.  
2. We create an **array of pointers** pointing to these variables.  
3. We print the original values through the pointers.  
4. We **add 5** to each value using the pointers.  
5. We find the **largest value** among them and show which pointer points to it.  
6. Finally, we print the updated values of the original variables.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile the program:

```bash
gcc modify_and_find_largest.c -o pointer_demo
